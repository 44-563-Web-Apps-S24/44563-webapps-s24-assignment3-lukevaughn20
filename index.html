<h2>Banadana's Bar-B-Que</h2>
<p>
I would say there are many reasons why Bandana's is my Favorite Restaurant. For started there different variety of <b>meats and sauces</b> make it for a different experience every time. 
I would also say that it is because of the <b>memories made with friends while there</b>. That is why Bandana's is my favorite restaurant.
